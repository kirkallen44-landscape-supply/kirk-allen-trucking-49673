      "reviewBody": "Ordered topsoil delivery, was told it be dropped between 10 and 12 and driver would call me when on the way, but that he would be picking up the load close to the jobsite. 12 rolled around with still no call from the driver, and made NUMEROUS calls into the office with no answer to coordinate or cancel load. Got a call from the driver 40 minutes after late end of deleivery window, and was told hes still 40 minutes to an hour out but loaded up with my material. Finally got in touch with the office, and was told \"i dont know why hes in Hackettstown\", and that she never gave me a delivery window. Not only did she give me a window the day prior, but also again the day off when i called to see what the deal was and thats when i was told hes picking up the load right by our jobsite and we should have it bt 12.\n\nSo not only are they nearly impossible to get a hold of, they have no handle on the whereabouts of their drivers or why they may be an hour away from a site they should have already dumped at.\n\nWould not reccomend to anyone actually in need of a reliable service. I understand delays happen, but the lack of ability to communicate, going back on words spoken, and the clear mismanagement of dispatch and the whereabouts of their drivers isnt acceptable.",

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Didn’t think it was possible to screw up gravel but Kirk Allen did it. 6 tons of 3/4 inch gravel ordered, delivered for a fee, and when I spread it, 1/3 of it was 1&1/2 inch. What a red, white and blue catastrophic failure this place.</div>

Rock looks beautiful around pool, front yard and in back yard for water run-off mitigation.  Will definitely use again for more landscaping needs.</div>

                    <div class="testimonial-text">Ordered topsoil delivery, was told it be dropped between 10 and 12 and driver would call me when on the way, but that he would be picking up the load close to the jobsite. 12 rolled around with still no call from the driver, and made NUMEROUS calls into the office with no answer to coordinate or cancel load. Got a call from the driver 40 minutes after late end of deleivery window, and was told hes still 40 minutes to an hour out but loaded up with my material. Finally got in touch with the office, and was told "i dont know why hes in Hackettstown", and that she never gave me a delivery window. Not only did she give me a window the day prior, but also again the day off when i called to see what the deal was and thats when i was told hes picking up the load right by our jobsite and we should have it bt 12.

So not only are they nearly impossible to get a hold of, they have no handle on the whereabouts of their drivers or why they may be an hour away from a site they should have already dumped at.

Would not reccomend to anyone actually in need of a reliable service. I understand delays happen, but the lack of ability to communicate, going back on words spoken, and the clear mismanagement of dispatch and the whereabouts of their drivers isnt acceptable.</div>
